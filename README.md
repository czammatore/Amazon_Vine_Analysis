# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Purpose

Our goal in this analysis was to determine if paid Vine members review products more positively than the average customer who is not compensated for trying the product and writing a review.

## Results

Our chosen review set to look at were shoes, since these are an item that most of the population use. There were a total of 27009 reviews, only 22 from members of the Vine program and the rest (26,987) from non-program members. Of those vine members giving reviews, none rated the footwear that they were reviewing with 5 stars. Further, 14,475 of the non-Vine reviewers gave their footwear purchase a 5-star review.

## Summary
Based on our results, it does not appear that participation the Vine program biases it's users to give products a more positive review than they would otherwise normally be  inclined to give. For this particular dataset, I'd be curious to see what the results are if the same analysis was run on 4, 3, 2 and 1 star reviews. We know our reviewers do not fall in line with the average customer for 5 star reviews, would they with those other categories?
Additionally, it would be interesting to explore if these results extend across other categories such as hair products, food items or home accessories.
